\chapter{Acknowledgement}

Many thanks to Prof.~Donald Knuth for giving us \TeX, and Leslie Lamport for \LaTeX.  

I first heard about \LaTeX{} as a postgraduate student in Australia. But back then, I have no idea how the \LaTeX{} works. Then, I started to learn how to \textbf{use} \LaTeX{} for conference/journal paper. I planned to write my Doctor of Engineering (DE) thesis (University of Fukui, Japan) in \LaTeX{} but somehow my supervisor is more comfortable with standard word processor. So, good bye \LaTeX{}!!. 

Back in Malaysia, I picked it up again because I want to make a \LaTeX{} template for postgraduate thesis in UniMAP. But, I started with FYP level first. Thanks to the \texttt{usmthesis.cls} template provided by \href{http://liantze.penguinattack.org/latextypesetting.html#usmthesis}{Lim Lian Tze}. 

%I hate to see some people do not use correct formatting even though the template (MS Word) has been given, especially for final examination paper. So to ensure no one comment on the formatting of my exam paper, (LoL \Smiley), I created a template for specific use for examination paper in UniMAP. You can find the exam paper template in my website \href{http://mohdhanafi.unimap.edu.my/template/}{http://mohdhanafi.unimap.edu.my/template/}. 
 
One thing led to another, and I now conduct trainings and consultations on \LaTeX\ in UniMAP (for the time being). %\Smiley

Hope everyone can GOT!
